## **ENPM661: Planning for Autonomous Robots**

## **Project 2: Implementation of Dijkstra algorithm for a Point and Rigid Robot**

## **Team Members:**

  * Shubham Sonawane (UID:  )
  * Revati Naik (UID: 116723015)

## **Problem Statement:**
Find the most optimal path from initial node to goal node using Dijkstra's Algorithm.



This project is divided into three sub-questions:

1. Checking the fesability of the given start node and goal node (if they lie in the obstacle space)

2. Implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm to find path between start node and goal node on a given map for point robot and rigid roobt

3. Output an animation of optimal path from start node to goal node on the graph. 


## ** Dependencies:**

1. shapely 

Install shapely pacakge from python3 using the following command on the terminal  `pip install shapely`

## **Running the code:**

There are two .py files

1. pointrobot.py
2. rigidrobot.py

Run the code on the commandline using the follwoing command `python3 pointrobot.py` and `rigidrobot.py`
